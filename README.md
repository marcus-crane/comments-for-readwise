# Comments for Readwise

A basic Manifest v2 extension for sending Hacker News comments to Readwise as "tweets"

At the moment, it's hardcoded to work with HN and you need to add your API token + add it locally.

Ideally it'd support a bunch more sources like [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) and ultimately, there'd be just a "comments" category instead of abusing "tweets" but it works for now.
