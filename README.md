# Comments to Readwise

A basic Manifest v3 extension for sending Hacker News comments to Readwise as "tweets"

At the moment, it's only hardcoded to work with HN but deally I'll support a bunch more sources like [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs).

Readwise will hopefully just a "comments" category down the line instead of abusing "tweets" but it works for now.
